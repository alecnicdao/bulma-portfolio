									As part of WEB 2500 (User Experience Design) course I took in Fall of 2019. We were introduced to the four-step User
									Experience design process which includes user research, design, testing, and implementation. The following
									topics were covered in the course: history of user experience, user behavior, cognitive processing, personas,
									web analytics, content stratedy, information architecture, wrting for the web, user-centered design, usability
									testing, and accessibiilty. Professor Sara Lleverino then had us design a website. The website must sell a product 
									or provide a service. In this case I chose to design a babysitting website. The reason for this was babysitting helps
									with peoples personal development. For instance, patience, problem-solving, communication nd relationship building,
									mulititasking, creative skills, and more. Also a reason is because everyone nowadays is looking for a babysitter, but 
									people struggle on finding the right one and how to find the right one and this site does that.

									I haven't really thought about how I would do this. But 
									I was thinking of wanting to build an app for the elderly people. We all 
									know they aren't tech savvy at all so I was thinking about building something 
									that is easy and that can keep them occupied. Especially elderly people that 
									feel miserable in those assisted living homes.

									For many years now I have been thinking about what is going to be the next big
									thing as far as social media. We have Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, 
									and now TikTok is making it's way up there. I have some ideas I want to do/build 
									as far as for the next social media app to use.

									This is the first app I am currently working on. LIVE' is an app for athletes/scouts all over the world. 
									Specifically, for atheletes from cities that aren't known for sports. What the app does is 
									you are able to post all of your highlight videos whether they are from the school you play for 
									or just a team you play for. The reason I wanted to design an app like this is for young athletes
									that want to pursue a career in the sport they play whether that's in basketball, football, soccer, 
									baseball, you name it.

									As part of CS 2350 course I took in Spring of 2019 with Linda Duhadway we developed a webpage portfolio. 
									Throughout the course we had to add to the webpage as we learned more about web development. 
									We first learned about the basics of HTML. For example, how to publish onto the web. Then we learned how to 
									do CSS (adding common style, header, navigation, etc.) Then, we did some JavaScript. For instance,
									how to add event listeners, how to create a form, and how to handle events on form elements. Lastly,
									we touched a little on jQuery. jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The 
									reason for us using it was to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. As for my website I 
									talked about sports a lot, specifically basketball.

							<div class="content">
								<p>
									With a foundation in client-side web design, development, and databases, I was able to explore server-side web
									frameworks and content management systems. Using these server-side technologies I was able to plan, design,
									and build a dynamic web application and website. Throughout this project I gained a better understanding of HTML,
									CSS, web usability, and visual design.
								</p>
								<p>
									Learning outcomes from this project included: HTML/CSS Documents, PHP Scripts, Syntax, Variables, Functions Forms
									and Framework, Common Programming Techniques, Concepts of SQL and the MySQL RDBMS, Connections to MySQL from PHP,
									Manipulate Information in a Database using PHP, Control Information and Program Flow.
								</p>
								<p>
									What I enjoy the most about PHP is that it is an easy scripting language to learn. I love how it gives web developers
									more control in what you want to do/build.
